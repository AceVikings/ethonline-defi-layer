# Compound V3 Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated Compound V3 (Comet) protocol supporting Base and Polygon mainnet networks.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Configuration (`config/compound.ts`)
- **Base Mainnet USDC Market**
  - Comet: `0xb125E6687d4313864e53df431d5425969c15Eb2F`
  - Base Asset: USDC
  - Collateral: WETH, cbETH, wstETH
  
- **Polygon Mainnet USDC Market**
  - Comet: `0xF25212E676D1F7F89Cd72fFEe66158f541246445`
  - Base Asset: USDC
  - Collateral: WETH, WBTC, WMATIC, stMATIC, MaticX

- Complete Comet ABI with all essential functions
- ERC-20 ABI for token approvals
- Chain-based config selection

### 2. Market Data Hook (`hooks/useCompoundMarketData.ts`)
Fetches real-time market information:
- Supply APY (calculated from per-second rates)
- Borrow APY (calculated from per-second rates)
- Utilization percentage
- Total supply and total borrow
- Base asset info
- Collateral assets list with logos

### 3. User Position Hook (`hooks/useCompoundUserPosition.ts`)
Tracks user's Compound positions:
- Base asset balance (positive = supply, negative = borrow)
- Borrow balance
- Individual collateral balances for each asset
- Wallet balances for all supported assets
- Collateralization status (health check)
- Flags for isSupplying and isBorrowing

### 4. UI Components

#### CompoundYield Component (`components/CompoundYield.tsx`)
Main interface displaying:
- Market overview with Supply APY, Borrow APY, Total Supply, Utilization
- User position summary (supplied, borrowed, collateral count, health status)
- Chain indicator (Base or Polygon)
- Protocol information
- Asset previews with logos
- Error handling and loading states

#### CompoundPage (`pages/CompoundPage.tsx`)
Dedicated page for Compound V3 with proper layout and styling

### 5. Navigation & Routing
- Added `/compound` route in `App.tsx`
- Added Compound navigation item in `Layout.tsx`
- Updated Dashboard stats to show 2 active protocols

## How It Works

### Network Detection
The app automatically detects which network the user is connected to:
- **Base (8453)**: Shows Base USDC market
- **Polygon (137)**: Shows Polygon USDC market
- Displays appropriate chain icon and name

### Data Flow
1. User connects wallet to Base or Polygon
2. `useCompoundMarketData` fetches market rates and protocol stats
3. `useCompoundUserPosition` fetches user's balances and positions
4. `CompoundYield` component displays everything with real-time updates

### Key Calculations
- **Supply APY**: `(supplyRate / 1e18) * secondsPerYear * 100`
- **Borrow APY**: `(borrowRate / 1e18) * secondsPerYear * 100`
- **Utilization**: `(utilization / 1e18) * 100`
- All balances formatted with proper decimals (6 for USDC, 18 for ETH, 8 for WBTC)

## Supported Operations (Ready for Implementation)

The infrastructure is ready to support:
1. **Supply Base Asset**: Earn interest on USDC
2. **Supply Collateral**: WETH, WBTC, WMATIC, etc.
3. **Borrow Base Asset**: Borrow USDC against collateral
4. **Withdraw Collateral**: Remove unused collateral
5. **Repay Borrow**: Repay borrowed USDC

## Next Steps

To complete the integration:
1. Create asset cards similar to AaveTokenCard
2. Add supply/withdraw/borrow/repay transaction flows
3. Implement approval flows for ERC-20 tokens
4. Add transaction status notifications
5. Integrate Avail Nexus bridge for cross-chain supplies
6. Add liquidation risk warnings
7. Show borrowing capacity calculations

## Networks Supported
- ✅ Base Mainnet (Chain ID: 8453)
- ✅ Polygon Mainnet (Chain ID: 137)
