# NodeFlow: Node-based DeFi Strategy Engine

**TL;DR:** Build a node-based strategy engine where each node is an "ability" (swap, Aave v3, transfer, AI, conditionals, inputs). Workflows composed of nodes run via Lit Protocol Vincent abilities (PKP-based execution) and use ASI agents to generate and refine strategies; LIT / Avail-style unified liquidity provides cross-chain execution.

---

## 🎯 High-level Vision

Create an extensible low-code workflow engine for DeFi strategies where:
- Each "node" is a reusable ability (a functional building block).
- Users or AI (ASI) compose node graphs that represent strategies.
- Vincent Apps (Lit Protocol) run the signed workflows trustlessly using PKPs and scoped delegation.
- Unified liquidity (Avail-style Nexus) and on-chain adapters handle cross-chain movement so the workflow author doesn't need to manage bridges.

Goals:
- Make automation safe and auditable (user confirmation points, policy enforcement).
- Make AI-driven strategies transparent (explainable recommendations and re-entry rules).
- Support rapid node extension: add new protocol abilities quickly.

## 🏗️ Architecture (NodeFlow)

High level components:

- Frontend: Workflow builder (canvas), node palette, node detail panels, monitoring UI. React + TypeScript.
- Node runtime / Orchestrator (Backend): Executes node graphs, maintains state, manages retries, simulation and dry-run.
- Ability adapters (on-chain): Small modules wrapping contract interactions (Aave V3, Uniswap, ERC20 transfer) and unified liquidity bridging adapters.
- Vincent Runner (Lit Protocol): Signed execution app that runs final transaction bundles under PKPs with scoped delegation.
- ASI Agents & Prompt Engine: Generate strategies, explain decisions, and produce node graphs or node configs.
- Storage & Telemetry: Persist workflows, history, logs, and metrics; provide auditing and rollback.

Diagram (conceptual):

```
User UI (Canvas)  --->  Orchestrator / Simulator  --->  ASI Agent (suggests/edits graph)
    |                           |                         |
    v                           v                         v
  Node Palette                 Execution Log           Vincent Runner (PKP)
    |                           |                         |
    v                           v                         v
  Node Graph JSON  --->  Node Runtime (execute/simulate) --->  On-chain / Nexus / LIT
```

## 📊 Flow for Node-based Strategies

1) Authoring: User or ASI Agent composes a node graph on the canvas and configures node inputs.

2) Simulation & Safety: Orchestrator simulates the graph (dry-run) — checks balances, gas, approvals, slippage, pre-conditions. Presents estimated outcome and risk measures to user.

3) Signing: User approves the workflow. The frontend generates a signed authorization (scoped rules) that the Vincent Runner will use via PKP to execute on behalf of the user.

4) Execution: Vincent Runner executes the bundled transactions and/or calls node adapters (swap, supply, transfer). Orchestrator tracks progress, retries recoverable errors, and logs all events.

5) Monitoring & Re-Entry: ASI Agents monitor markets and can propose automatic re-entry or hedge motions (subject to user policy and delegated scopes).

---

## Node-Based Strategy Plan (nodes, semantics, validation)

We will treat each node as an "ability" (small, testable unit). Nodes are typed and declarative. Each node defines:
- inputs: typed (number/string/address/token/boolean)
- outputs: typed (amount/address/bool/errors)
- preconditions: checks to run before execution
- error modes: retryable / fatal / compensating actions

Node Catalog (MVP):

1) Swap Node (DEX Swap)
- Purpose: swap token A → token B via a DEX (Uniswap/Sushi/1inch)
- Inputs: fromToken (address), toToken (address), amountIn (number or "max"), slippageTolerance (decimal), routeHints (optional)
- Outputs: amountOut (number), txHash, estimatedGas
- Prechecks: allowance, balance >= amountIn, price impact < threshold
- Errors: insufficient liquidity (fatal), slippage exceeded (retryable with increased slippage), tx fail
- Example use: rebalance portfolio or convert volatile asset to stablecoin

2) Aave V3 Node (Lending Supply / Withdraw / Borrow / Repay)
- Purpose: interact with Aave V3 markets
- Inputs: action (supply/withdraw/borrow/repay), token, amount, useAsCollateral (boolean)
- Outputs: newBalance, txHash
- Prechecks: token supported, health factor (for borrow/withdraw), approvals
- Errors: insufficient collateral (fatal for borrow), borrow cap hit
- Note: we already have Aave code—wrap it into this node with Zod schemas

3) Token Transfer Node
- Purpose: simple ERC-20 transfer to an address
- Inputs: token, recipientAddress, amount
- Outputs: txHash
- Preconditions: balance check, approval if using proxy

4) AI Node (ASI-driven)
- Purpose: call ASI to generate data-driven decisions or to produce subgraphs
- Inputs: systemPrompt (string), userPrompt (string), inputData (object/schema), modelOptions
- Outputs: structuredResponse (JSON matching schema), explanation (string), suggestedNodes (node graph fragment)
- Preconditions: inputData validated against schema
- Errors: rate limit, invalid response (must validate JSON)
- Execution: ASI call returns JSON which gets validated and optionally converted to nodes (automation)

5) If/Else Node (Conditional)
- Purpose: branch execution based on boolean condition
- Inputs: conditionExpression (string or compiled AST) — evaluated in sandbox with runtime variables
- Outputs: chosenBranchIdentifier
- Security: sandboxed evaluation, no arbitrary code execution

6) Comparison Node
- Purpose: numeric/string comparison to produce boolean
- Inputs: leftValue, operator (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=), rightValue
- Outputs: boolean

7) Input Nodes (Number / String / Address)
- Purpose: user-supplied static inputs or flow-injected values
- Inputs: typed value, optional validation rules (min/max, regex)
- Use: provide parameters to other nodes

8) Composite / Macro Node
- Purpose: bundle common patterns (e.g., "Convert to stable + deposit to Compound") as a reusable macro

9) Oracle/Price Node
- Purpose: fetch price / volatility / TWAP from Chainlink or CoinGecko for decision-making
- Inputs: token, timeframe
- Outputs: currentPrice, change1h, change4h, volatilityScore

10) Delay / Wait Node
- Purpose: pause execution until a time or condition (re-entry criteria)

11) Notification Node
- Purpose: send alerts to user (webhook/email/push) with signed evidence and action links

12) Composite Execution Node: VincentRunner
- Purpose: package several node outputs into an atomic execution using Vincent PKP
- Inputs: list of transaction steps, preconditions, replay protection

Node semantics notes:
- All nodes are pure declarative descriptions until the VincentRunner executes them.
- Orchestrator performs a full pre-execution simulation and produces an execution plan plus gas/approval list.

## Integrations

- LIT / Vincent: each final executable bundle is run by Vincent Runner. The Runner must support:
  - Scoped PKP invocation, replay protection, gas payment hints.
  - Accept a serialized plan (node graph or transaction bundle) and run it under user delegation.

- Unified Liquidity Adapter (Avail-style): router that supports "bridge & execute" primitives or single-call cross-chain liquidity.

- ASI / Agent Layer: Agents produce node graphs or node fragments. Key agents:
  - Market Analyzer: produces price/APY/volatility nodes or data.
  - Risk Assessor: produces risk scores and preconditions for If/Else nodes.
  - Strategy Composer: returns suggested node graph fragments and human-readable reasoning.

- Contract Adapters: small packages that wrap Aave v3, Compound v3, DEX routers, ERC20 transfer; provide Zod schemas for inputs.


---

## Frontend Requirements (UX / Builder)

- Visual canvas (drag-and-drop) with node palette and live validation.
- Node configuration panel with typed fields, examples, and "simulate" button.
- Pre-execution simulation view: shows estimated gas, approvals required, slippage, estimated outcome and risk metrics.
- Audit trail & live logs: step-by-step execution logs, tx hashes, ability outputs.
- Safety controls: confirmation gates, delegated scopes UI, policy management (e.g., "never swap above 1% slippage").
- Templates & macros: pre-built workflow templates for Crash Protection, Yield Shift, Auto-Hedge.
- ASI Chat integration: contextual assistant that can suggest nodes or generate graphs; display reasoning and JSON output.

## Backend Requirements (Orchestrator & Runners)

- Node Runtime / Orchestrator
  - Accepts node graph JSON and executes simulation and dry-run.
  - Maintains workflow state machine, supports retries, compensating actions, idempotency.
  - Runs simulation deterministically (mainnet-fork or price oracle snapshot).

- Adapter Library
  - Small modules per protocol encapsulating contract calls + schema validation.
  - Expose: simulate(inputs) -> estimatedOutputs, buildTx(inputs) -> txRequest

- Vincent Runner
  - Translates buildTx outputs into a bundled call for Vincent PKP.
  - Verifies replay protection, signs with PKP, submits, streams logs back to Orchestrator.

- ASI / Agent Service
  - Endpoint to request strategy generation, node-fragment suggestions, and explanation strings.
  - Caching and rate limiting for ASI calls.

- Storage & Telemetry
  - Persist workflows, versions, execution history, and per-step telemetry.
  - Provide exportable JSON to share or audit.

## AI Node / Prompting Patterns

- AI Node must follow a strict contract: systemPrompt, userPrompt, inputSchema, outputSchema.
- Agent should return structured JSON and optionally a serialized node-graph fragment. The orchestrator validates JSON using Zod-like validators before accepting.
- Provide templates for two AI roles:
  1. "Strategy Composer" — outputs node graph fragment + priority and rationale.
  2. "Crash Detector" — outputs boolean crash flags and re-entry criteria.

Security / Safety in prompts:
- No action is executed without explicit user-approved scope. ASI only proposes; Vincent runs only approved bundles.

## Security & Governance

- PKP & Delegation Policies
  - Scoped delegations: the PKP only has authorization for specified abilities and value limits.
  - Timebox delegation: optional expiry or session-based delegation.

- User Confirmation Model
  - Explicit approval for every workflow that affects > X USD (configurable).
  - Consent recorded on-chain (or signed metadata) for auditability.

- Sandbox & Simulation
  - Orchestrator must simulate and show expected state change and gas before asking for approval.

- Policy Engine
  - Global policies (e.g., never execute if gas > Y gwei; never accept slippage > 2%) enforced server-side before signing.

- Secrets & Keys
  - No private keys stored on servers. PKP handles signing via Vincent.

## Testing & QA

- Unit tests: node adapters, simulator, prompt validation.
- Integration tests: orchestration + Vincent Runner with Lit Datil-Test and Avail testnet.
- Mainnet fork tests: deterministic simulation for safety.
- Fuzz tests: random node graphs for resilience.

## Branding & Frontend UX Update

- New product name: **NodeFlow** (or keep AlphaFlow as umbrella) — emphasize "nodes" and "flow".
- Visual language: node tiles, color coded priorities (URGENT/High/Medium/Low), clear risk badges.
- Logos and assets: produce a small brand kit (icon, color palette, fonts). Prefer a modern, developer-friendly look.
- Microcopy: clarity on "what will execute", "what you sign", and "what you delegate".

## Roadmap & Phases (Suggested)

Phase 0 — Planning & Spec (this doc)

Phase 1 — MVP (4 weeks)
- Implement node runtime & editor MVP (canvas + swap, transfer, Aave nodes)
- Implement orchestrator simulation and preflight checks
- Vincent Runner integration (Datil-Test), basic PKP flows
- ASI Agent: Strategy Composer prototype (returns small node fragments)

Phase 2 — Safety & AI (4 weeks)
- Policy engine, scoped delegations, timeboxing
- Full ASI integration (crash detection prompts, recovery prompts)
- Add compound nodes, macro nodes, templates

Phase 3 — Cross-chain & Production (6 weeks)
- Unified liquidity / Avail integration for bridge & execute
- UX polish: templates, onboarding, audit logs
- Extensive testing and security review

Phase 4 — Advanced features
- Scheduled workflows, event-driven triggers, marketplace of node macros

## Example Workflows (so devs know what to build)

1) Crash Protection Workflow
- Input: watchedTokens [WETH], threshold (4h_drop >= 10%)
- Steps: OracleNode -> CompareNode -> If True -> AI Node (explain) -> Swap Node (WETH→USDC) -> Supply Node (USDC→Compound)

2) Yield Shift Workflow
- Input: baseAsset USDC, target APY threshold
- Steps: PriceNode (APY) -> CompareNode -> If APY target -> Withdraw Node -> Swap Node -> Supply Node

3) Re-entry Workflow
- Trigger: Recovery detection
- Steps: WaitNode -> PriceNode -> AI Node -> Swap Node -> Supply Node

## Deliverables (for the initial sprint)

- `node-runtime` service (simulate + execute)
- `frontend` workflow builder (React) with Swap/Aave/Transfer nodes
- `adapter-abilities` package with Aave v3 wrapper and DEX swap wrapper
- `vincent-runner` integration for Datil-Test
- ASI Agent prototype for recommending node graphs

## Next Steps (immediate)

1. Finalize node JSON schema (Zod) and types for all planned nodes.
2. Implement Orchestrator skeleton and simulation API (dry-run route).
3. Implement Swap Node adapter + local unit tests.
4. Wire Aave node to existing Aave code, wrap in adapter.
5. Prototype AI Node that returns validated JSON node-fragments.

This new `PLAN.md` scopes out the node-based strategy engine you asked for: swap, Aave v3 (we have code), token transfer, AI node with system/user prompts and structured outputs, conditional and comparison nodes, and typed input nodes. It also covers integration points for Vincent (LIT), unified liquidity adapters, frontend builder UX, backend orchestrator, safety/policy, and an initial roadmap. Do you want me to (A) create the node JSON schema and Zod validators next, or (B) scaffold the `node-runtime` service and a simple Swap node adapter first?
- **Emergency Withdrawal**: User can always force withdraw (bypasses AI)

### AI Risk
- **Human Oversight**: All large moves require confirmation
- **Sanity Checks**: Reject strategies with >50% single-protocol allocation
- **Audit Trail**: All AI decisions logged with reasoning

### Cross-Chain Risk
- **Avail Security**: Nexus uses proof-of-stake consensus + validity proofs
- **Bridge Limits**: Cap cross-chain transfers at $1000 per transaction
- **Fallback**: If bridge fails, funds stay on source chain

---

## 🎬 Demo Script (3 Minutes)

**[0:00-0:30] Problem**
> "Managing DeFi across chains is painful. You need to bridge manually, track APYs across 50 protocols, rebalance when rates change, and pay gas on every chain. Most people give up and settle for suboptimal yields."

**[0:30-1:30] Solution**
> "AlphaFlow solves this with AI agents + unified liquidity. Watch: I deposit $100 USDC on Ethereum. The AI analyzes yields across 12 chains and recommends: 65% Aave on Arbitrum, 25% Morpho on Base, 10% Lido on Ethereum. I approve with one click. Avail Nexus bridges my USDC and executes all deposits in a single transaction. No manual bridging, no complexity."

> "Six hours later, Aave's APY drops. The AI notices and proposes rebalancing to Morpho. I get a notification, review the reasoning, and approve. It executes automatically via Lit Protocol Vincent abilities. Trustless, transparent, optimal."

**[1:30-2:30] Technology**
> "How does it work? Three technologies:
> 1. **Avail Nexus** provides unified liquidity - one transaction to execute across 12 chains
> 2. **ASI Alliance** powers the AI - uAgents monitor markets, MeTTa knowledge graphs reason about strategies, ASI:One chat lets me override decisions
> 3. **Lit Protocol Vincent** executes trustlessly - programmable key pairs that only do what I approve, no custody, full control"

**[2:30-3:00] Call to Action**
> "AlphaFlow makes DeFi accessible. You focus on your goals, AI handles optimization. Try it at alphaflow.xyz. All code is open source. Thank you!"
